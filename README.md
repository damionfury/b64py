# Reimplementing base64 encode and decode
I learn better when I have a goal in mind. After seeing an article about how base64 encode and decode functions work, I got it in my head to write my own implementation in python.

## Goal
Create a module that offers base64 encode and decode

## Roadmap
1. Make a function that can base64 encode a string
2. Make a function that can base64 decode a string
3. Modify the functions to work with any data
4. Turn it into a module that can be imported.

## Where am I at?
Step 2 is done.

## Can I use this?
Yes, but why? There is no rational reason for you to use this. Still – if you're dead set on making bad decisions – it's licensed CC0. I'd kinda prefer you left my name out of it.
